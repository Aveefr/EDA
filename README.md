# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering

This repository contains my work on exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and prediction modeling based on the techniques learned from a YouTube tutorial series and additional personal exploration.

## Overview

I have undertaken this project to delve into the fundamentals of exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, guided by a comprehensive YouTube tutorial series by Krishnaik06. The primary goal was to gain practical insights into data preprocessing, visualization, and feature manipulation techniques, culminating in building predictive models.
